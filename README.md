# viper2

Viper 2 is a file analysis and management framework. It aims to provide a solution to easily organize your collection of malware and exploit samples as well as your collection of scripts you created or found over the time to facilitate your daily research. It is a Python 3 rewrite of the original [Viper](https://github.com/viper-framework/viper), which is now discontinued.

## Get started
